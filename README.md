Udacity Nano Degree: Near-Earth Motivational Meme Generator

# Basic Instructions

# Project Rubric

## I. Project Setup and Code Style

1. Write code that is PEP compliant and follows common programming best practices.

    The code adheres to the PEP 8 style guide and follows common best practices, including:

   - Variable and function names are clear.
   - The code is DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) and methods demonstrate the principle of composition.


2. Create basic documentation.

    All included docstrings and comments adhere to PEP 8 standards. 
    A README file is included in the project root and includes:

    - an overview of the project.
    - instructions for setting up and running the program.
    - a brief description of the roles-and-responsibilities of all sub-modules including dependencies and examples of how to use the module.

3. Consume public libraries using virtual environments.

    The code makes use of public libraries using a virtual environment with the bash command
    ```bash
        $ python3.11 -m venv ./venv
    ```

    All required dependencies are listed in the root requirements.txt file which was created using the bash command.
    ```bash
        $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

    The program runs with no errors.

    (Optional) If git is used, the virtual environment directory is added to the .gitignore file.

4. Implement basic Python exception handling.
5. Create Python modules.



## II. Quote Engine Module

1. Implement basic object-oriented data structures.
2. Identify when to use Abstract Base Classes (ABC) in Python and implement this design pattern in the code.
3. Ingest text files using the native file library.
4. Ingest DOCX files using the python-docx library.
5. Ingest PDF files using CLI tools.
6. Ingest CSV files using the pandas library.
7. Implement class inheritance in Python using the strategy object design pattern and apply DRY (don't repeat yourself) principles



## III. Meme Generator Module

1. Use the Pillow library to perform basic image operations.





## IV. Package your Application

1. Use Python arg variables for CLI execution.
2. Interface with web resources using flask and requests.
